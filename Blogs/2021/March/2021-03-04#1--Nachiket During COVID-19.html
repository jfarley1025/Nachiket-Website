    <p>Children we serve totally depend on Nachiket for their educational and
      reading needs. They are falling behind at alarming rates.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The staff is collaborating with other organizations with similar aims,
      and Primary School teachers. This way we are able to provide library
      services to small groups of children across the village and at the
      library.</p>

    <p>Online learning has become an urgent necessity. We have purchased One
      Laptop, Smart Phone, and four Tablets for a village of Satnoor. Â We do
      have a plan to equip at least five other libraries.</p>
