      <p>By building learning capabilities we are paving the way to brighter future.
Children love participating in various competitions, quizzes, as well as reading/writing
workshops and Fun with Science. Our readers say that Nachiket introduces to them the whole
wide world outside their village. Children’s superb artwork shows their creative and
imaginative power.</p>
      <br>
      <p><i>"Now our readers are teachers, engineers, pharmacists, policemen, and even woman- sarpanch."</i></p>

      <p>Seema, who is now completing Engineering Degree in Nagpur, says &mdash;</p>
      <br><p><i>“I consider myself lucky. Every child in every village, town, and city ought to have access to a
library like this.”</i></p>

      <p>Priti, now studying for B. Pharm., appreciates the alternative
        independent learning environment provided by Nachiket in her own village
        that is still not available to many children from nearby villages.</p>
        <br>
      <p>Yogesh is thankful that he got to explore a way beyond just the textbook
        world of his school.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Children are extensively using libraries for their school projects on
        subjects such as the effect of pollutants on the local farms, and space
        travel based on a book at Nachiket that gives detailed accounts of real
        travels to the moon with actual photos.</p><br>
