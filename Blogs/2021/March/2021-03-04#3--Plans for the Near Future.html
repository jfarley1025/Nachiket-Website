    <p>We want to upgrade our prototype of a one-room village childrenâ€™s library and replicate in
      many more villages. Amravati District has 1,200 villages.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We have a plan to establish at least one ideal library with ample space for:</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>An attractive display of books and reference material</li>
        <li>Book clubs, Science Fun, storytelling, and computer literacy programs</li>
        <li>Easy accessibility to online educational material</li>
      </ul>
