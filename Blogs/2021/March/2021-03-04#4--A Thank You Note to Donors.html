    <p>By gift-wrapping the quest for knowledge, joy of reading and
      inspiration, you are paving the way to a brighter future.</p><br>

    <p>Because of your enthusiastic support we continue to provide and maintain a creative
      learning forum, a second-to-none book collection, and unique
      library services such as Storytelling in which mothers are involved.
      These are the home without books.</p><br>

      <p>Your financial support is invaluable; every donated dollar has a
        huge impact on a child's life.</p><br>

        <p>Your generous support means we can update learning resources and
          expand our reach to more villages.</p>
